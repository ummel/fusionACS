<p>The table below provides abbreviated metadata for the variables
available in the latest release of the fusionACS microdata
pseudo-sample.</p>
<p>At present, only a handful of variables are fused from some of the
donor surveys – often for the specific research purposes of fusionACS
team members. We hope to expand the number of variables in the future.
If there are particular variables or topics of interest that you would
like to see included, please let us know.</p>
