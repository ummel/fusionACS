### Overview

A fusionACS *analysis* consists of a request for an *estimate* (mean, median, sum, proportion, or count) of a particular variable across one or more sub-populations. For example, "Mean household electricity consumption in Chicago, by census tract"; or "Proportion of low-income households in Atlanta without air conditioning". In addition to a point estimate, fusionACS also returns the associated uncertainty or *margin of error*.

There are two fundamental sources of uncertainty when performing an analysis using fusionACS data. First, there is uncertainty in the fused *outcomes* for ACS respondent households; i.e. uncertainty in the values predicted by the underlying machine learning models. Second, there is uncertainty in the assigned *weight* for each respondent; i.e. uncertainty about how often a sampled respondent "type" appears in the actual population.
