    "text": "Overview\nA fusionACS analysis consists of a request for an estimate (mean, median, sum, proportion, or count) of a particular variable across one or more sub-populations. For example, “Mean household electricity consumption in Chicago, by census tract”; or “Proportion of low-income households in Atlanta without air conditioning”. In addition to a point estimate, fusionACS also returns the associated uncertainty or margin of error.\nThere are two fundamental sources of uncertainty when performing an analysis using fusionACS data. First, there is uncertainty in the fused outcomes for ACS respondent households; i.e. uncertainty in the values predicted by the underlying machine learning models. Second, there is uncertainty in the assigned weight for each respondent; i.e. uncertainty about how often a sampled respondent “type” appears in the actual population.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
